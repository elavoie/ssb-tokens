usage: ssb-coin create [<options>] <number> <currency>

Create <number> coins of type <currency>. <number> can be an integer or a 
floating point value. <currency> is a string.

Examples:
 
    ssb-coin create 3 "hours"
    ssb-coin create 10.23 "USD"
    ssb-coin create 7 "Bakery Credits (Euros)"
    ssb-coin create 15 "2020 CSA Baskets"

New coins can only be minted using one of your SSB IDs.

<options> (default?, default value, type):

    --id=ID (true, ID=valueOf(".ssb/secret/public"), SSB_ID)
        SSB ID (public key) of the creator of coins. Your SSB installation 
        should have access to the corresponding private key for the 
        operation to succeed.

    --description=DESC (true, DESC=null, SSB_MSG_ID)
        Describes the purpose of the coins. DESC can either be null or an
        SSB Message ID. The description message can be created by any
        author (i.e. it can be someone else than you).

    --non-transferable (false, Boolean)
        The coins can only be given once to a different owner.

    --non-burnable (false, Boolean)
        The coins cannot be burned after a transfer.

    --smallest-unit=VALUE (true, VALUE=0.01, Number)
        The coins can be given in units of no less than VALUE.

See 'ssb-coin help ssb' for an explanation of the Secure-Scuttlebutt 
concepts (ex: SSB_MSG_ID) used.
