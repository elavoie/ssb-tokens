usage: ssb-tokens give [<options>] <number> <tokens> [<number> <tokens>, ...] <ssb_id>

Transfer <number> <tokens> to <ssb_id>.

<number> is the number of tokens to transfer, as an integer or a floating 
    point value . It should be equal or less than the number of <tokens> 
    available. 
<tokens> can be the creation message of the tokens (SSB_MSG_ID), a transfer 
    message (SSB_MSG_ID), the type of currency mentioned in a creation 
    message (ex: "USD"), or the description referred by the creation 
    message (SSB_MSG_ID).
<ssb_id> is the alias or the SSB_ID of the recipient.

Examples:
    
    ssb-tokens give 2 "hours" "@elavoie"
    ssb-tokens give 2.53 "USD" "@andre"
    ssb-tokens give 6 "%AFdafed..." "@YMaf8a..."

<tokens> may implicitly refer to multiple creation messages, ex: when the 
currency or description message have been used by multiple creation 
messages. By default, the <tokens> will be spent in chronological order,
i.e. the oldest tokens will be spent first. You may specify a different
order by explicitly specifying the SSB_MSG_IDs to transfer from.

To be valid, a new transaction should:
    1. Unambiguously determine the amount and origin of tokens, from one 
       or multiple sources;
    2. Have available and valid transaction histories from the original 
       creation message up to each source of tokens;
    3. Use a number of tokens, from each source of tokens, less or equal 
       to the number of tokens available.

<options> (default?, default value, type):

    --description=DESC (true, DESC=null, SSB_MSG_ID)
        Describes the purpose of the transfer. DESC can either be null or an
        SSB Message ID. The description message can be created by any
        author (i.e. it can be someone else than you).

See 'ssb-tokens help ssb' for an explanation of the Secure-Scuttlebutt 
concepts (ex: SSB_MSG_ID) used.
