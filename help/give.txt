usage: ssb-coin give [<options>] <number> <coins> [<number> <coins>, ...] <ssb_id>

Transfer <number> <coins> to <ssb_id>.

<number> is the number of coins to transfer, as an integer or a floating 
    point value . It should be equal or less than the number of <coins> 
    available. 
<coins> can be the creation message of the coins (SSB_MSG_ID), a transfer 
    message (SSB_MSG_ID), the type of currency mentioned in a creation 
    message (ex: "USD"), or the description referred by the creation 
    message (SSB_MSG_ID).
<ssb_id> is the alias or the SSB_ID of the recipient.

Examples:
    
    ssb-coin give 2 "hours" "@elavoie"
    ssb-coin give 2.53 "USD" "@andre"
    ssb-coin give 6 "%AFdafed..." "@YMaf8a..."

<coins> may implicitly refer to multiple creation messages, ex: when the 
currency or description message have been used by multiple creation 
messages. By default, the <coins> will be spent in chronological order,
i.e. the oldest coins will be spent first. You may specify a different
order by explicitly specifying the SSB_MSG_IDs to transfer from.

To be valid, a new transaction should:
    1. Unambiguously determine the amount and origin of coins, from one 
       or multiple sources;
    2. Have available and valid transaction histories from the original 
       creation message up to each source of coins;
    3. Use a number of coins, from each source of coins, less or equal 
       to the number of coins available.

<options> (default?, default value, type):

    --description=DESC (true, DESC=null, SSB_MSG_ID)
        Describes the purpose of the transfer. DESC can either be null or an
        SSB Message ID. The description message can be created by any
        author (i.e. it can be someone else than you).

See 'ssb-coin help ssb' for an explanation of the Secure-Scuttlebutt 
concepts (ex: SSB_MSG_ID) used.
