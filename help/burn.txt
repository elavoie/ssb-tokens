usage: ssb-tokens burn <tokens> [ <tokens>, ... ] [ <options> ]

Destroy <tokens>. 

<tokens> can be a creation or a transfer operation (SSB_MSG_ID).  

Examples:

    ssb-tokens burn "%AFda..." --author @bob
    ssb-tokens burn "%AFda..." "%BteA..."

You can only destroy tokens that you own. <tokens> should be operations that
have not been spent, partially or completely. To burn amounts from partially
spent sources, give them to yourself first and then burn the new give operation.

<options> (default?, default value, type):
    --author=ID (true, ID=valueOf(".ssb/secret/public"), SSB_ID)
        SSB ID (public key) of the owner of tokens. Your SSB installation 
        should have access to the corresponding private key for the 
        operation to succeed.

    --description=DESC (true, DESC=null, SSB_MSG_ID)
        Describes the purpose of the transfer. DESC can either be null or an
        SSB Message ID. The description message can be created by any
        author (i.e. it can be someone else than you).

See 'ssb-tokens help ssb' for an explanation of the Secure-Scuttlebutt 
concepts (ex: SSB_MSG_ID) used.
