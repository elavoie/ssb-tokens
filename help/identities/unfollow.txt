usage: ssb-tokens identities unfollow <ssb-id> [<options>]

Stop following another <ssb-id>. Their messages may not be
replicated anymore but existing messages say in the local
database.

Examples:

    ssb-tokens identities unfollow @ABCD...
    ssb-tokens identities unfollow @bob --author @alice

<options> (default?, default value, type):

    --author=ID (true, ID=valueOf(".ssb/secret/public"), SSB_ID)
        SSB ID (public key) of the follower. Your SSB installation 
        should have access to the corresponding private key for the 
        operation to succeed. (included in tokenType)

See 'ssb-tokens help ssb' for an explanation of the Secure-Scuttlebutt 
concepts (ex: SSB_MSG_ID) used.
